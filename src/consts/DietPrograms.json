Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Let completely cool before eating. You can vary the ingredients for different flavors--use other sugars instead of honey, use jam instead of the raisins, use different nuts if you don't want the pronounced flavor of peanut (like cashew, almond, hazlenut, etc.) They pack easily and seem to improve in flavor overnight.
